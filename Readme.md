Week 02 - Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

Description
The files index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html are webpages for "About Me", "Portfolio Grid" and "Contact Me Form"

Styling
Used Bootstrap 4 and CSS for styling. 

Website's elements adjust to the changes with the size of the browser. 

The website contains the following: 
- A navbar
- A responsive layout
- Responsive images in a grid
- Contact form

Roadmap
- Still looking to add a background as the "container's" margins are hindering the addition of a background image.
- Toggle-button for the navbar to be fixed.
